# LiaScript: A Domain-Specific-Language for Interactive Online Courses

> __1.__ Use the arrow buttons above for navigation

See this project on:

* GitHub: https://github.com/andre-dietrich/e-Learning-2019
* LiaScript: https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andre-dietrich/e-Learning-2019/master/README.md#1

LiaScript is an attempt to enable everyone to create free and interactive online
courses, without the need of being an experienced programmer. Instead, it aims
to bring both parties, software- and course-developers, closer together by
introducing Open-Source techniques into the Open-courSe development process.
LiaScript was designed to be compatible to Common-Markdown, but it introduces
lots of language extensions that deal with quizzes, surveys, ASCII-art,
text2speech, animations, online programming, the integration of JavaScript, etc.
as well as its own macro-system that simplifies tedious and repetitive tasks. It
comes along with its own Just-In-Time compiler that runs in the Browser and
therefor does not require additional tooling.

## 1. Introduction

                             --{{0}}--
LiaScript was initially developed within the _"Industrial eLab-Project [^1]"_,
which aims to make university hardware and laboratories accessible via the
Internet. But, we soon realized that only by giving remote access to these
resources via a fancy website we will run into problems. Our mobile
Arduino-Bots could be used to teach programming, sensing, navigation, dive into
operating systems or even to apply artificial intelligence. Thus, the real
problem was to develop an extendable and adaptable system for creating courses
(instead of a single Web-App) with different objectives and for students with
different backgrounds, which only interface with our hardware other
external resources.

                              {{0-1}}
![robot](pics/robot.jpg)<!-- width="100%" -->

                             --{{1}}--
Surely, creating an online-course from scratch requires a lot of expertise in
different web technologies at front-end (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, CSS, testing),
back-end (e.g., webservers, databases), and different communication standards to
connect both sides (e.g., CRUD, WebSockets, AJAX). Hence, it is nearly
impossible for a non-programmer to understand all of these issues, before
starting to develop his or her own online course.

                              {{1-2}}
![eLab](pics/eLab.jpg)<!-- width="100%" -->


                             --{{2}}--
Screen- or pod-casts are not a real alternative, since they are expensive and
time-consuming in production, not easy to change or translate, and require
additional skills in movie cutting. That is why platforms such as Udacity or
Coursea invest a lot of effort and money in high-quality course productions,
which is comparable to movie productions, including screenplays, actors,
different sets and locations. Fortunately, there are also course platforms that
try to ease the course development for non-experts, such as Ilias, edX, Moodle,
amongst others.


                             --{{3}}--
But how is such a kind of "simplicity" achieved? Mostly, by offering
integrated configuration-systems and editors, that shall enable the user to
create a course with a lot of buttons and menus, sub-sub-menus, and masks, whose
only purpose is to hide the non-intuitive syntax and semantics of a language
that can be easily interpreted machines, not by humans.


                               {{3}}

> applied by humans, in order to describe their intentions, and let the

## 2. Adapting OpenSource Development

                             --{{0}}--
More or less, all the aforementioned systems have drawbacks in some of the
following points:

**Requirements from an OpenSource perspective**

1. No support for larger course developer-teams, including those who develop
   additional functionality and those who provide content
2. No versioning, in contrast to Wikipedia as a single source of truth, content
   shall be provided in different "styles" for heterogeneous groups of students
3. No reusability, parts of one course cannot simply be applied of copied into
   another project
4. No support for internationalization/localization (i18n), thus a course cannot
   simply be translated into another language
5. No variance in representation
6. Difficulties in adopting and integrating new web technologies

                             --{{1}}--
Pin-points 1 and 2 can be easily solved by applying version control systems like
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org),
[Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org), etc. and their web-based hosting
services such as [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com),
[SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net), etc. to name only a few. All required
resources, including images, videos, data-sheets, JavaScript and CSS-styles, and
everything else can be easily uploaded and made available via the internet.


### 2.1 Why Markdown?

                             --{{0}}--
Markdown is a simple meta-markup language used to structure and annotate simple
text documents. Its goal is to keep the source text easy to read and write, that
is why it has become more or less the standard documentation-format for
OpenSource-projects. Originally, it was developed to write HTML content
efficiently, without having to use a WYSIWYG editor. Directly writing a markup
language such as HTML is considered too error prone and annoying for the writing
process. Of course, we are not the first ones that apply Markdown to ship
educational contents, earlier examples are:

* [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com):
  it is a command line tool (and Node.js library) for building (responsive e-)
  books using GitHub/Git and Markdown
* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org):
  a free parser for multi-document formats, which can be used convert between
  various document-based file formats and it has also support for and extended version of Markdown
* [markdown-elearnjs](https://github.com/elb-min-uhh/markdown-elearnjs):
  converter for Markdown documents into responsive OER websites, which allows integrating quizzes, interactive images, videos, etc.
* and others ...

                             --{{1}}--
Of course there are other approaches and systems such as
[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) must be mentioned in any case, which
can be applied for literate programming, if the document is download and all
required resources are installed locally. But the commonality of all system is
that it's about creating static documents, which, although it is translated into
a more beautiful format, still have to be read. To our knowledge, our approach
is the only one that deals with the creation of interactive presentations, which
are still generated from simple and static Markdown documents.


### 2.2 What is LiaScript?

                             --{{0}}--
In contrast to other Markdown compilers that generate static HTML, LiaScript is
an interpreter that downloads and renders the original Markdown document
directly within the browser. That means, if the Markdown document is updated,
the resulting representation will be updated too. Thus, there is no need for
additional tooling, compiling steps, or server-side support.  LiaScript was
implemented from scratch with Elm[^2] for efficiency and speed, which includes
its own parser and run-time environment.


* Online interpreter, that runs directly within the browser
* Written in Elm[^2]
* Support for different representation styles (see [Sec. 2.3.5](#11))
* New Markdown language features:
  _Quizzes_, _Coding_, _Animations_, _Multimedia_, _ASCII-art_, ...

                             --{{1}}--
One of our design goals was to support different rendering modes, which covers
the traditional textbook mode, next to presentations with animations and spoken
text. Furthermore, we extended the language itself with various features, that
should transform Markdown from a traditionally static meta-markup approach into
something new, suitable for interactive online courses and more.


[^2]: Elm is a functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript,
      see the project-website: https://elm-lang.org


### 2.3 Extensions to Markdown

> __Why does Markdown only support static content?__
>
> We came a long way from written scrolls to printed books to electronic books,
> which can still be printed out or copied by hand! But, actually it is the same
> old format that has been brought to a new device. Although a computer and the
> Internet give us much more opportunities for visualization, interaction, or
> story telling ...


#### 2.3.1 Multimedia

                             --{{0}}--
Markdown supports 2 types of links (onto internal and external resources), which can be either direct or formatted:


                              {{0-1}}
*******************************************************************************

__Markdown-Code: (Reference)__

``` markdown
* Direct reference:
  https://LiaScript.github.io

* Formatted reference:
  [Link to LiaScript](https://LiaScript.github.io)
```

__Result:__

* Direct reference:
  https://LiaScript.github.io

* Formatted reference:
  [Link to LiaScript](https://LiaScript.github.io)

**********************************************************

                             --{{1}}--
Images can be included via formatted references that start with an exclamation
mark:

                              {{1-2}}
*******************************************************************************

__Markdown-Code: (Image)__

``` markdown

```

  width="100%"
-->

*******************************************************************************

                             --{{2}}--
In contrast to this, it is still complicated to include multimedia content.
Based on the previous notation, it is possible in LiaScript to mark a link as an
audio-file by adding a starting question-mark, which can be interpreted as an
ear.

                              {{2-3}}
*******************************************************************************

__LiaScript-Code: (Audio)__

``` markdown
?[Joy to the world](http://www.orangefreesounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Joy-to-the-world-song.mp3?_=1)
```

__Result:__

?[Joy to the world](http://www.orangefreesounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Joy-to-the-world-song.mp3?_=1)

*******************************************************************************


                             --{{3}}--
Due to the combination of images and sound, it is possible to insert videos. One
of the benefits that lays in this notation is that every common Markdown-viewer
will still generate a fully working link to these resources.


                              {{3-4}}
*******************************************************************************

__LiaScript-Code: (Video)__

``` markdown
!?[The eLab-Project on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/embed/bICfKRyKTwE)<!--
width="560px"
height="315px"
-->
```

__Result:__

!?[The eLab-Project on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/embed/bICfKRyKTwE)<!--width="560px" height="315px"-->

*******************************************************************************

                             --{{4}}--
You might probably have noticed, that some examples contain HTML-comments with
additional annotations. This is a cheap way of formatting any kind of elements,
such as text, images, tables, videos, etc. A starting comment defines the format
of the entire block, whereby a trailing comment changes the format of its
predecessor only.


                               {{4}}
*******************************************************************************

__LiaScript-Code: (Annotations)__

``` markdown
<!--style="color: red"-->
This whole paragraph will be colored in red ;-)<!--
class="animated infinite bounce"
style="animation-delay: 3s;"
-->, but only this smiley is going to start jumping
after 3 seconds.
```

__Result:__

<!--style="color: red"-->
This whole paragraph will be colored in red ;-)<!--
class="animated infinite bounce"
style="animation-delay: 3s;"
-->, but only this smiley is going to start jumping
after 3 seconds.


*******************************************************************************

                             --{{5}}--
This way it is even possible to define complex animation-sequences, while the
content remains readable with another Markdown-Viewer, since they tend to ignore
comments.

#### 2.3.2 ASCII-Art 1

                             --{{0}}--
From our experience, we know that a lot of produced images represent simple
diagrams that represent functions, some signal waves, or some trends. These have
to be generated with Excel, Gnuplot, Matlab or other tools, and to be exported,
which makes it also difficult to change them or to translate labels. LiaScript
offers the opportunity to draw diagrams directly within the document. Such
diagrams can be easily adapted and it is necessary to switch to another "tool".


``` HTML
                         Title and axes are optional
    1.9 |    DotS
        |                 ***
      y |               *     *
      - | r r r r r r r*r r r r*r r r r r r r
      a |             *         *
      x |            *           *
      i | B B B B B * B B B B B B * B B B B B
      s |         *                 *
        | *  * *                       * *  *
        +------------------------------------
        0              x-axis               1
```

                             --{{1}}--
This is turned into a nicely rendered diagram, wherein the color and the size of
dots is defined by the original characters.


        <!--style="max-width: 720px"-->
                         Title and axes are optional
    1.9 |    DotS
        |                 ***
      y |               *     *
      - | r r r r r r r*r r r r*r r r r r r r
      a |             *         *
      x |            *           *
      i | B B B B B * B B B B B B * B B B B B
      s |         *                 *
        | *  * *                       * *  *
        +------------------------------------
        0              x-axis               1


#### 2.3.3 ASCII-Art 2

                             --{{0}}--
If necessary, it is also possible to depict complex issues, such as graphs,
UML-diagrams, or even pictures with the help of simple characters.

``` HTML
                           .--->  F
  A       B     C   D     /
  *-------*-----*---*----*----->  E
           \            ^ \
            v          /   '--->  G
             B --> C -'
```

<!-- style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 315px;" -->
`````````````````````````````````````
                           .--->  F
  A       B     C   D     /
  *-------*-----*---*----*----->  E
           \            ^ \
            v          /   '--->  G
             B --> C -'
`````````````````````````````````````

                             --{{1}}--
Additionally, it is also possible to use any kind of Unicode-character. Thus,
LiaScript has support for Chinese, Greek, Arabic, or any other kind of
characters and symbols.

#### 2.3.4 Quizzes

                              --{{0}}--
One of the language feature we wanted at most, was an easy way to integrate
quizzes in different flavors and thus, to give students the possibility to check
their knowledge. Quizzes are always associate with double brackets, such that to
add a text quiz, you only have to enter the solution in double braces and the
input field, check and show solution buttons are automatically generated.


                               {{0-1}}

                               --{{1}}--
Some might adapt the question to handle the ambiguity in this case. But let us
try out what LiaScript has to offer. It is either possible to add hints, by
adding question-marks in double brackets and let the user decide if he needs
help, by clicking on the associated button in the rendered course. The optional
`script`-tag allows to check the input, in this case to trim it and to transform
it lower-case and finally to compare it with different allowed solution.
Therefor the `@input`-macro gets replaced by the current user input. The
trailing Markdown-blocks surrounded by two lines of stars show a more detailed
explanation, which appears either if the user input was correct or if the user
clicked onto the resolve button.

A single-choice quiz is defined by stylized radio buttons, where the `X` marks
the right solution and only one line is allowed to contain the `X` contain.
Extensions with hints, solutions, or JavaScript checks can also be applied.

How would you encode a multiple-choice quiz with a typewriter, probably
similarly as we did it. It looks like a list of simple check-buttons that
define the solution. You can add as much rows/options and of course add also
hints, scripts, or an explanation...

A generic quiz can be defined with the help of an exclamation-mark in double
brackets and a `script`-tag. In this case a random-number is used to generate
the outcome. Additional HTML-elements might be required to define different
input possibilities.

#### 2.3.5 Output Modes

                               --{{0}}--
In the following two parts are intended to explain, how a section can be divided
into several fragments and how speech output can be generated.


                                {{0-1}}
![boring](https://media.giphy.com/media/HlqvH9JrahLZ6/giphy.gif)<!-- width="100%" -->

                               --{{1}}--
If you are using the online rendered version of this course at LiaScript
website. You will, probably have noticed that there is a button in the upper
right corner. It allows switching between three different display modes. It
allows to let the user decide for himself, if he or she rather wants to listen
to the explanatory text as in a presentation or to read it like a book.

                                 {{1}}
1. Presentation (with voice output)
2. Slides (with notes ...)
3. Textbook (without fragmentation and voice output)


##### 2.3.5.1 Fragmentation

                               --{{0}}--
Defining fragments and revealing them step by step is quite simple, only a
number has in double braces has to put in front of a Markdown-block. Fragments
with only one number will sustain until the end of a slide. A point of
disappearance can be defined by putting a minus and a second number into double
braces. Inline fragments can be defined by putting the fragment number and the
elements to appear into successive braces. And it is also possible to attach
different blocks to the same fragment number, either by attaching a number to
every block or by putting them into a body of stars, as it was done with the
solution in section [quizzes](#9).

``` markdown
                  {{1}}
This text will appear at {3}{__inline is also possible__}first.


{{2-4}} This block will appear afterwards and
disappear at step number 4.

I am here to the end of slide ...

{{4}} I come at last.
```

                  {{1}}
This text will appear at {3}{__inline is also possible__}first.


{{2-4}} This block will appear afterwards and
disappear at step number 4.

I am here to the end of slide ...

{{4}} I come at last.


##### 2.3.5.2 Voice Output

                               --{{0}}--
Voice output is implemented with the help of
[ResponsiveVoice](http://responsivevoice.org). Within an initial `comment`-tag
at the beginning of the document, it is possible to define the default voice for
a course. This voice can be changed at every section as well as within every
voice comment itself. Such comments are treated as extended fragments, which are
used explain certain fragments in more detail. Therefor, they are defined
similar to block-fragments surrounded by minuses, whereby only paragraphs are
allowed to follow. Depending on the presentation mode, these texts are either
displayed within the slide or read out loud. This way it is also possible to
implement a dialog between different persons.


``` markdown
<!--

### 2.4 Extending LiaScript

                               --{{0}}--
In the previous sections we had presented syntactic extensions to Markdown. But
the Internet is full libraries and possibilities that a might be necessary for a
particular course or topic. In contrast to many other Markdown-interpreters
LiaScript allows integrating JavaScript, HTML, and CSS directly within the
document. Additionally, it has support for a macro-notation that allows
automating and thus simplify repetitive and tedious tasks.

![www](https://media.giphy.com/media/RxR1KghIie2iI/giphy.gif)<!-- width="100%"-->

#### 2.4.1 ... with JavaScript and HTML

                               --{{0}}--
It is possible use HTML everywhere and if you want to make use of a certain
JavaScript library or CSS-file, their URLs have to be included in the main
comment-tag at first. Using the keyword `script` followed by a colon and a URL
or multiple URLs, JavaScript can be integrated and similarly by using the
keyword `link` style-sheets can be loaded.

``` html
<!--
script: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/chartist.js/latest/chartist.min.js

link:   https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/chartist.js/latest/chartist.min.css
-->
```

                               --{{1}}--
Afterwards it is possible everywhere to access the new functionality. The
following example depicts, how the JavaScript library
[Chartist](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/) is used to plot a certain
graph.

                                 {{1}}
``` html
<div class="ct-chart ct-golden-section" id="chart">
</div>

<script>
  let chart = new Chartist.Line('#chart', {
    labels: [1, 2, 3, 4],
    series: [[100, 120, 180, 200]]
  });
</script>
```

                               --{{2}}--
And this is the resulting graph rendered by Chartist ...

                                 {{2}}
<div class="ct-chart ct-golden-section" id="chart"></div>
<script>
  $.getScript("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/chartist.js/latest/chartist.min.js", function(){
    let chart = new Chartist.Line('#chart', {
      labels: [1, 2, 3, 4],
      series: [[100, 120, 180, 200]]
  })});
</script>

#### 2.4.2 ... with Macros


                               --{{0}}--
In section [2.3.4 Quizzes](#9), the `@input` macro has already been used to mark
the replacement for the user input. A macro always starts with an `@` symbol and
can be defined in the "main" comment of a document. Macros describe simple rules
for text replacement. For the one-line `@red` macro, everything following the
colon defines the replacement text. Parameter substitutions are defined by a `@`
symbol followed by a number.


                                {{0-2}}
``` html
<!--
...
@red: <b style="color: red"> @0</b>
...
-->
```

                               --{{1}}--
These extensions can then be used arbitrarily in the document, as shown in the
following example.

                                {{1-2}}
*******************************************************************************

``` markdown
> This is a block-citation contains
> a @red(very important) example...
```

---

> This is a block-citation contains
> a @red(very important) example...

*******************************************************************************

                               --{{2}}--
A macro can also call other macros, and more complex macros can be defined as a
block consisting of multiple HTML, Markdown, or JavaScript elements. In this
example the use of Chartist should be simplified by changing the ID for the
`div` element and the content to be drawn is passed as the second parameter.

                                 {{2}}
``` html
<!--
...
@Chartist
<div class="ct-chart ct-golden-section" id="chart@0">
</div>
<script>
  let chart = new Chartist.Line('#chart@0', {@1});
</script>

@end
...
-->
```

                               --{{3}}--
This macro can also be called via a "function-like" notation. Since commas are
used as separators for the parameters, back-ticks must be used here to pass the
second parameter as an entire string. Admittedly, for very long entries, this
can quickly become unreadable.

                                {{3-4}}
*******************************************************************************

``` markdown
@Chartist(id1,`labels: [1,2,3], series: [[1,3,1]]`)
```

---

@Chartist(id1,`labels: [1,2,3], series: [[1,3,1]]`)

*******************************************************************************

                               --{{4}}--
For this reason, macros can also be called within a code-block, therefor only
the respective macro must be called in the head of the block. The body of the
block is then passed as a single parameter. This makes it easier to define
complex macros and additionally, all popular Markdown-viewers should at least
display this kind of inputs in a nicely rendered code-block with syntax
highlighting, which enables the interpretation of data.


                                 {{4}}
*******************************************************************************

``` markdown
` ` `json @Chartist(id2)
labels: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
series: [
  [100, 120, 180, 200, 0, 12, -1],
  [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 90, -100]]
` ` `
```

---

```json @Chartist(id2)
labels: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
series: [
  [100, 120, 180, 200, 0, 12, -1],
  [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 90, -100]]
```

*******************************************************************************


### 2.4 Executable Code

                               --{{0}}--
The following syntax can be used to combine several Markdown code-blocks into
one project. To the different files titles can be associated, and they can be
opened and closed. The additional `script` tag at the end identifies these
blocks as executable code and defines how to handle the contents of each block.
In this case the `@input` macro is called with a parameter, which defines which
code-block gets substituted at this position.


                                {{0-1}}
``` markdown
` ` ` js     -EvalScript.js
let who = data.first_name + " " + data.last_name;

if(data.online) {
  who + " is online"; }
else {
  who + " is NOT online"; }
` ` `
` ` ` json    +Data.json
{
  "first_name" :  "Sammy",
  "last_name"  :  "Shark",
  "online"     :  true
}
` ` `
<script>
  // insert the JSON dataset into the local variable data
  let data = @input(1);

  // eval the script that uses this dataset
  eval(`@input(0)`);
</script>
```

                               --{{1}}--
The LiaScript interpretation of these blocks then looks like this. All files are
editable and a linear version management system is used to track changes. Try
it, change the code and go back to earlier versions.


                                {{1-2}}
``` js     -EvalScript.js
let who = data.first_name + " " + data.last_name;

if(data.online) {
  who + " is online"; }
else {
  who + " is NOT online"; }
```
``` json    +Data.json
{
  "first_name" :  "Sammy",
  "last_name"  :  "Shark",
  "online"     :  true
}
```
<script>
  // insert the JSON dataset into the local variable data
  let data = @input(1);

  // eval the script that uses this dataset
  eval(`@input(0)`);
</script>


                               --{{2}}--
As shown in section [2.3 Extending LiaScript](#13), it is also possible to
integrate different JavaScript functionalities and libraries, so that also
different programming languages can be supported. The example below shows a
simple _C_ program that can be compiled and executed using the
[rextester API](https://rextester.com/main). The more complex definition of the
associated `script`-tag was provided using the `@Rextester.eval` macro. Only by
attaching such a macro, any code block can be turned into an executable one.


                                {{2-3}}
``` c source_file.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int i; // Try to delete the semicolon
         // to see what happens next...

  for(i=0; i<10; ++i) {
    printf("Hello, World! #% d\n", i);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
@Rextester.eval


                               --{{3}}--
The combination with other languages and visualizations (using HTML and
JavaScript) is also possible, see the interactive example for the programming
language [_Processing_](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing):

                                 {{3}}

For such JavaScript libraries and also for the use of other functionalities, we
offer templates that have been implemented via our macro system[^3]. These
can be used freely and furthermore it also minimizes the breaks when reading the
original Markdown document.

[^3]: List of LiaScript templates:
      https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/templates/master/README.md#1

## 3. Conclusion

                                --{{0}}--
Looking back onto [section 2.](#3), we did not discuss points 3 to 6 so far.
LiaScript was build around the idea of course-development as an OpenSource
project.

                                --{{1}}--
Thus, anything from one course can be used in another course, either by linking
directly onto a slide or by simply copy and pasting the required parts
(__req 3__). Furthermore we offer a growing number of templates, which are
founded on our macro-system, that ease the usage and integration of new and
complex web technologies (__req 6__).

                                --{{2}}--
LiaScript currently supports three different styles of rendering modes (see
[Sec. 2.3.5](#11)), allowing every user to choose his/her preferred type
(__req 5__). Concerning the preferred course language, translating a single
text-document is much easier than translating a whole software-project or a
YouTube-video or podcast and LiaScript offers some options that allow to host
different language versions of one course at the same project (__req 4__).


                                  {{1}}
* (3.) Reusability --> anything can simply be copied into any course
* (6.) Integrating new web technologies --> via a macro-system and templates


                                  {{2}}
* (5.) Variance in representation -> three different modes
* (4.) Internationalization/localization (i18n) --> supported by specific header
